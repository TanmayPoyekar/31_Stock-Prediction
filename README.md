Description:
The project will use Python programming language library to implement LSTM algorithm. The 
historical stock market data will be obtained from Yahoo Finance and pre-processed to extract 
relevant features. The data will be divided into training and testing sets and the LSTM model 
will be trained on the training set. The model will then be used to generate predictions on the 
testing set. The accuracy of the model will be evaluated using various metrics such as mean 
absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE).
